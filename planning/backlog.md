## Must-Haves

1. Basic Layout and Design:

2. Start Functionality: Implement the ability to start the stopwatch, initiating
   the counting of elapsed time from zero. This feature must accurately measure
   time and update the display in real-time.

3. Stop Functionality: Include the capability to pause the stopwatch, halting
   the counting of elapsed time. This functionality must freeze the timer
   display while allowing users to resume timing from the paused state.

4. Reset Functionality: Provide the option to reset the stopwatch to zero,
   clearing all previously measured time. This feature should enable users to
   start timing anew after resetting, without any lingering elapsed time.

## Should-Haves

1. Timer Display: Incorporate a clear and easily readable display for the
   stopwatch timer, showing elapsed time in hours, minutes, and seconds format.

2. User-Friendly Controls: Design intuitive controls for starting, stopping, and
   resetting the stopwatch, ensuring ease of use for both novice and experienced
   users. Use universally recognized icons or labels to enhance usability and
   reduce cognitive load.

## Could-Haves

1. Advanced Timing Features: Include advanced timing features such as lap timing
   or split timing, allowing users to record multiple time intervals within a
   single timing session.
2. Session History: Implement a session history feature that records and
   displays previous stopwatch sessions, including start time, stop time, and
   total elapsed time. This allows users to review their timing history and
   track progress over multiple sessions.
